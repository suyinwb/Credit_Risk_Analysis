# Credit Risk Analysis

## Background

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, you’ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Jill asks you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, you’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, you’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, you’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once you’re done, you’ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

* Balance accuracy score of 0.6595 means that this model correctly classify 65.9% the loans correctly according to high and low risks.
* Precision score
  - high risk: 0.01 means that this model correctly classify and flags 1% high risk loans. That means 99% of the flagged high risk were not actually high risk.
  - low risk: 1.00  means that this model correctly classify and flags 100% low risk loans
* Recall (sensitivity) score
  - high risk: 0.64 means that this model correctly classify and flags 64% high risk loans. That means 36% high risk were not flagged.
  - low risk: 0.68  means that this model correctly classify and flags 68% low risk loans

## Summary

From all the models above, only Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier has a higher accuracy at 92.5%. The rest of the models only have accuracy scores between 59% to 67%.

Easy Ensemble model also has a high recall / sensitivity score for high risk as 91%, meaning it correctly classify 91% of high risk. The rest of the models do not have such accuracy hovering around 60% accuracy. High precision accuracy is important in order to minimise potential loan holders who have higher chance of defaulting the loans.

Right now, it seems like Easy Ensemble is the better model for our prediction. However Easy Ensemble has precision score of only 7% for high risk, meaning that 93% of the high risk flagged are actually low risk loans. This is actually not good for LendingClub as it will mean a high loss of potential business.

Due to the low precision score above, even Easy Ensemble is not a good model for LendingClub to predict high and low risk loan holders.

In summary, I will not recommend any of the prediction models above to LendingClub.
